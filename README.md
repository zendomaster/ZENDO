Developing a wellness app that is linked to a meme utility coin. Our AR app is designed to promote wellness and tranquility, with a special focus on engaging the crypto community. 
"Discovery" phase. This phase involves several critical activities, including:
1.	Idea Conceptualization: Defining the core idea and purpose of the app. Understanding what problem it will solve or what need it will fulfill.
2.	Market Research: Analyzing the target audience, market trends, and competitors. This helps in understanding the potential demand and differentiating features for the app.
3.	Requirement Gathering: Collecting detailed requirements for the app. This includes functional requirements (what the app should do) and non-functional requirements (performance, usability, security, etc.).
4.	Feasibility Study: Assessing the technical, financial, and operational feasibility of the app idea. This helps in determining whether the app can be developed within the available resources and constraints.
5.	Prototyping: Creating wireframes or mockups to visualize the app's design and user interface. This helps in refining the concept and getting early feedback.
6.	Project Planning: Defining the project scope, timeline, budget, and resources. Setting up a project plan with milestones and deliverables.
7.	Technical Planning: Deciding on the technology stack, architecture, and development approach. This includes selecting the appropriate tools, platforms, and frameworks.
8.	Risk Assessment: Identifying potential risks and challenges that might arise during the development process and planning for mitigation strategies.
Technology Stack
